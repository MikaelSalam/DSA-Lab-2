Authorization is the process of what resources a user can access or use after their identity has been verified through Authentication. Authentication is a process of verifying who you are and your identity ,  for example logging in with a password. Authorization on the hand tells what you are allowed to do after your identity has been verified. Authorization is all about access control and authorization usually comes after authentication.There are Authorization mechanisms which are known as RBAC (Role Based Access Control) and ACL (Access Control List) and the Principle of Least Privilege. RBAC assigns permissions based on roles within an organization for example like an employee vs a manager. ACL defines specific permission for individual users or groups in particular resources. Each resource has a list specifying who can access it. Principle of Least Privilege ensures users are granted only minimum access necessary to execute their tasks which limits damage if accounts of users are hacked or compromised.Authorization is an important way of protecting data from being stolen and enforcing security policies.
